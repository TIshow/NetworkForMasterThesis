In many countries, food manufacturers are required by law to include nutritional values on packaging. But in the United States, these labels are missing from alcoholic beverages. Alcohol was illegal in the US between 1920 and 1933, and after it was legalized, Congress formed a new agency to regulate it. As a result, the Food and Drug Administration does not have jurisdiction over alcohol. So, in 1990 when the FDA made it mandatory for food companies to include nutritional facts on their packaging, the laws did not apply to alcohol. For those who are concerned about food safety and potentially dangerous ingredients, or anyone simply trying to watch their weight, this poses a problem. Various consumer groups have attempted to change these laws, but the beverage industry has always fought back - and they have some powerful lobbyists in Washington. They argued that if they were required to put nutrition labels on alcohol, it would lead consumers to believe that alcohol is nutritious. Regulators made the labels optional for alcoholic beverages, but most manufactures simply do not include them. As a result, some alcoholic beverages contain some ingredients that may be linked to health problems. Budweiser, and many other American beers, contains genetically modified corn, which has been the subject of much debate in the US. Some beers, like Samuel Adams, have only slightly fewer calories than a McDonald's Hamburger over 200 per glass. For anyone counting calories, a few beers on a Friday night can easily undo all that hard work throughout the week. Consumer groups argue that people have a right to know what theyâ€™re putting in their bodies so that they can make smarter choices and avoid potential health problems later in life.
